Obesity is a critical global health challenge and a leading risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and certain cancers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight, with more than 650 million classified as obese. This epidemic significantly contributes to the global burden of disease, exacerbating healthcare costs and impacting quality of life.
Despite its widespread prevalence, obesity often remains underdiagnosed or poorly managed due to its multifaceted nature, involving genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. The rising prevalence, particularly in low- and middle-income regions, highlights the urgent need for advanced, accessible methods to classify and predict obesity levels effectively.
that LightGBM and XGBoost offer the best performance in predicting obesity levels after applying SMOTE, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of 92%. These models are highly effective in addressing class imbalances and outperforming traditional models like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. Furthermore, they provide a solid foundation for clinical applications, especially in resource-limited settings, where their interpretability and high accuracy could be leveraged for better obesity risk management and early intervention.
This study highlights the importance of utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, particularly ensemble methods like XGBoost and LightGBM, for improving the prediction and classification of obesity, contributing to enhanced health outcomes.
